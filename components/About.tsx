          I&rsquo;m Neeraj Kaushik — a developer who thrives at the intersection of sleek web experiences and solid backend logic and web development. With a strong grip on the MERN stack and hands-on experience in React , I love building applications that not only look great but work seamlessly under the hood.

            I&rsquo;ve solved 200+ LeetCode problems, sharpened my skills in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and confidently use JavaScript, and C++ when needed. Whether I&rsquo;m designing APIs, optimizing queries, or building smooth cross-platform UIs, I bring a problem-solving mindset to every project.

            </p>
            <p>
            I care about clean code, meaningful user experiences, and making tech that scales. Currently, I&rsquo;m looking for an internship where I can contribute, learn from real-world challenges, and grow as a full-stack web develper.

            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to continue learning,build real life problem solving applications and impactful software that makes a difference in people&rsquo;s lives. I&rsquo;m always open to new 
              challenges and collaborations to enhance my knowledge and experience.
